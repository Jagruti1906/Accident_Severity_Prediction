# Accident_Severity_Prediction

Accident severity prediction is a crucial field that can help prevent accidents and minimize their impact by providing early warning to drivers, emergency responders, and other stakeholders. By using data and statistical methods, accident severity prediction models can accurately forecast the likelihood and severity of accidents and help stakeholders make informed decisions that can save lives and reduce the cost of accidents. With the potential benefits of machine learning techniques, this field will likely continue to evolve and contribute to improving road safety and saving lives.

### Methodology ###

1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Development
4. Model Evaluation

### Dataset Description ###

This dataset covers car accidents all over the USA, including 49 states, from February 2016 to December 2021. The data is collected from sources like cameras, sensors, and user reports. It has details about where and how severe accidents are, including factors like weather and nearby locations. Features include accident times, severity, location (latitude, longitude), weather, distance to points of interest, and more.

### Conclusion ###

This project aimed to predict how bad accidents are using computer models. We tested different models like random forest, decision trees, and logistic regression. It involved several steps including data loading, pre-processing, visualization, feature reduction, and model development. The results show that these models can predict accident severity well, with random forest being the best. We also learned which parts of data matter the most. This can help make better rules to prevent bad accidents. Overall, this project shows how models can guess accident severity and reminds us to prepare data carefully for the best results.
